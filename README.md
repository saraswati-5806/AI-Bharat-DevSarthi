🚀 **DevSathi: Vernacular-First AI Tutoring Ecosystem**

Bridging the gap between static technical textbooks and practical coding through a unified, vernacular-first AI tutoring ecosystem.

DevSathi is a RAG-powered learning platform designed for the Indian student (Bharat). It eliminates the "Language-Logic Gap" by providing localized analogies and a unified workspace that combines resource viewing, AI tutoring, and live coding.

📌 **Problem Statement**:
Students in Tier-2 and Tier-3 cities often understand complex technical logic but are hindered by English-heavy documentation and context-switching fatigue (jumping between PDFs, AI chats, and code editors).

✨ **Key Features**
🧠 **Domain-Agnostic RAG**: Upload any PDF (NCERT, University Notes) for document-specific, hallucination-free tutoring. 

🗣️ **Vernacular Code-Switching**: AI explains logic in native dialects (Hindi, Tamil, etc.) while keeping technical syntax in English for exam readiness. 

💻 **3-Column Adaptive Lab**: A unified interface featuring an integrated PDF Viewer, Vernacular AI Chat, and Monaco Code Editor. 

🛡️ **VertiScore Guardrails**: A unique verification layer that ensures all AI responses are 100% factually accurate against the source document.

**🛠️ Technical Ecosystem**

**Frontend Interface**
1. Framework: Next.js 14 (App Router)
2. Styling: Tailwind CSS
3. Code Editor: Monaco Editor (The core of VS Code)

**AI & Intelligence Layer**
1. LLM Reasoning: AWS Bedrock (Claude 3 Haiku)
2. Vector Embeddings: AWS Titan Text Embeddings
3. Orchestration: LangChain / Python FastAPI (Serverless)

**Data & Infrastructure**
1. Vector Database: Amazon OpenSearch Serverless
2. Document Storage: Amazon S3

**NoSQL Database: Amazon DynamoDB (User progress & logs)**

**🚀 Future Roadmap**
**Short Term:** Speech-to-Text for hands-free coding and multi-modal support for handwritten diagrams. 
**Mid Term:** Offline-First PWA for students in low-connectivity rural areas. 
**Long Term:** Peer-to-Peer Learning Network for quality control of AI-generated vernacular analogies.

**📈 Potential Impact**
**Inclusivity**: Democratizing high-quality tech education for 1M+ students in Tier-2/3 cities. 
**Efficiency**: Reducing the "Learning-to-Coding" turnaround time by 40%.
